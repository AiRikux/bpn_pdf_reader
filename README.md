# BPN PDF Reader

I am currently interning as an auditor and noticed there's an abundance of files each with its own code and amount that needs to be recorded. Based on these files I will try to create a PDF reader that output the code and amount in each page of the PDF.

I don't think I will upload the file but soon I'll try making an outline of what it looks like.
